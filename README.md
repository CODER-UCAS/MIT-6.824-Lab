# MIT-6.824-Lab
This is a public implementation of MIT 6.824 labs.
Based on original code, we implemented this project.

# MapReduce part
***Mapreduce*** is the first design and implementation of large scale distributed system in real world.\
 In general, a typical ***MapReduce*** system contains two major parts:\
  &emsp; *Map tasks management*\
  &emsp; *Reduce tasks management*\
  &emsp; *Master/work deployment and scheduling*\
In our project, we implemented this parts. check out codes of *MapReduce* in 
*MIT-6.824-Lab/6.824/src/mapreduce/...*
